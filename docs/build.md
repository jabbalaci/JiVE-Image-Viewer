[dev] Build automation
======================

I chose [pynt](https://github.com/rags/pynt) as a build automation
solution. It's simple, intuitive and can be programmed in Python.
I also have a blog post about it [here](https://pythonadventures.wordpress.com/2018/06/09/pynt-a-lightweight-build-tool-written-in-python/).

If you install the dev. dependencies in your virtual environment (`$ pipenv install --dev`),
then you get the command `pynt`. Activate the virt. env. and launch `pynt` without any parameters.
As a result you'll get a list of available tasks.
