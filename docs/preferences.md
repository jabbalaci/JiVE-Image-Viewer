Preferences
===========

There's a `preferences.ini` file that allows you to customize
some settings of JiVE. The `preferences.ini` file contains lots
of comments that I don't want to repeat here.

The default settings are OK in my opinion.

You may have to customize `editor` and `gimp`.

Next to `editor` specify your favorite text editor. When
you go to *View* -> *Important files and folders* and
you click on Open next to a file, the given file
will be opened with the editor that you specify here.

Next to `gimp` specify the path of the Gimp image manipulation
program. An image can be opened in Gimp the following
way: right click -> *Open with...* -> *Gimp*. At the
moment only Gimp is supported as an external image editor.
