Sequence URL
============

When you open a gallery, very often the URLs of the images follow a simple pattern:

* http://www.example.com/gallery/01.jpg
* http://www.example.com/gallery/02.jpg
* ...
* http://www.example.com/gallery/20.jpg

These URLs can be represented in a compressed form: http://www.host.com/gallery/[01-20].jpg

For JiVE you can specify such a URL (called sequence URL). JiVE will restore the
URLs and open them.
