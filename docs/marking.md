Marking images (save, wallpaper, delete)
========================================

While browsing images, you may want to save some.
Maybe some of them would be great wallpapers for your
desktop. When you browse local images, maybe you would
like to delete some from the file system.

All these operations are supported. The idea is that
first you just mark the images ("I want to save this",
"save it as a wallpaper", "delete this image"). When
you are ready with that, you can commit your changes.

With pressing *s*, you can mark an image to be saved.
The image will be saved in your user data dir.'s "saves" sub-folder.

With pressing *w*, you can mark an image to be saved as
a wallpaper.
The image will be saved in your user data dir.'s "wallpapers" sub-folder.

With pressing *d*, you can mark an image to be deleted.
The image will be removed from the file system.

When you press *s*, *w* or *d*, JiVE will mark the image
and bring you to the next image.

To undo your changes, press *s*, *w* or *d* on an image.
No changes are made until you commit them!

When you are done, press *c* to commmit your changes.
Warning! Deleted images will be gone!

With *Ctrl+A* you can mark all the images to be saved.
