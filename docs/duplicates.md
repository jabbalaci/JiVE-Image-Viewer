Find duplicates
===============

When you browse a local folder, it may contain the same image
under different file names. How to remove the duplicates?

Go to *Tools* -> *Find duplicates*. JiVE will mark duplicates
to be deleted (notice the big red 'D' in the top left corner).
Pressing *c* will commit your changes, i.e. the duplicates will
be removed.

For instance, you have the same images three times. JiVE will
keep the first one, but it'll mark the 2nd and 3rd images to
de deleted.
