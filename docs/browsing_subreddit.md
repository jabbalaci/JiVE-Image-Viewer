Browsing a subreddit
====================

When you open a subreddit, only the first page is loaded.
If you go to the last image and press the *right* arrow
for instance, JiVE will ask if you want to load the next page.
It's like an infinite scroll.

If you enable `auto_load_next_subreddit_page` in the preferences file,
then the next page is loaded automatically, without asking
any question.
