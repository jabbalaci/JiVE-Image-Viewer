JiVE (Jabba's Image Viewer)
===========================

A general purpose, cross-platform image viewer with some built-in NSFW support, written in Python 3 using PyQt5.
A unique feature of JiVE is that it allows you to browse online images just as if they were local images.

This is a work in progress... but it's already usable.
